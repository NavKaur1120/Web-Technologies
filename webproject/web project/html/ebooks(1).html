	</p></li>
	<li><p><b><i> Contents drop-down menu</i></b>:-	<img src="../media/dropdownmenu.jpg" width="450";height="550" align="right" ></a>
	It is a good way to jump to chapters in the book or we can go to any article in a magazine. Books in the public domain are available for "full view" and can be downloaded for free. In-print books acquired through the Partner Program
	are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission, although this is rare.For in-print books where permission has been granted, the number of viewable pages is limited to a "preview" set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures, some based on user-tracking. Usually, the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview.[15] Users are restricted from copying, downloading or printing book previews. A watermark reading "Copyrighted material" appears at the bottom of pages.
	All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview.
	</p></li>
	<li><p><b><i>Overview Page Overhaul</i></b>:<img src="../media/overviewpage.jpg"width="555";height="490" align="right" ></a>
	It is an assortment of data all about book including reviews, rating, summaries, key words and phrases
	related books, references  from the web, places mentioned in the book and publisher information.It help readers to find
	famous and interesting book very easily.A 'snippet view' – two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term – is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview. This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission. If a search term appears many times in a book, Google displays no more than three snippets, thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book. Also, Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books, such as dictionaries, where the display of 
	even snippets can harm the market for the work. Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view.</p></li>
